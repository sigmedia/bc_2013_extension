    In the following test, you will listen a set of samples.
    At each step, the same text has been synthesized by multiple systems.
    You will have to rank these systems in respect to the following guidelines:
    <ul>
      <li>The most natural sample should be ranked at position "1", the second most natural at position "2" and so on</li>
      <li>If you consider two or more samples to be equivalent, give them the same rank.</li>
      <li>All the samples have to be listened in their entirety at least once and ranked before moving to the next step</li>
      <li>You won't be able to go back after you submitted one step</li>
      <li>Please do the test in one session (without break), in an environment which is as quiet as possible, in order to avoid biasing the data</li>
      <li><b>One sample has been degraded on purpose and should always be ranked last</b></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Before the evaluation itself, you will have an training step for you to get familiar with the controls.
      The training step is identical to the core of the evaluation itself but we don't record the information.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform monitors the following actions:
      <ul>
        <li>when do you play a sample</li>
        <li>when do you rank a sample</li>
      </ul>
      Our goal is to determine if there are some common strategies between the participants.
    </p>

      Finally, here is a small video showing how the platform works. <b>You have to watch the video fully before moving to the training step</b>.
